# Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

## Project Overview
This project focuses on capturing and analyzing live network traffic
using Wireshark to understand protocol behavior and identify abnormal
traffic patterns.

---

## Objectives
- Capture live network traffic
- Analyze common network protocols
- Identify suspicious or abnormal behavior

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Wireshark
- Command Prompt
- Web Browser

---

## Implementation Details
- Captured live packets from the active network interface.
- Generated traffic using web browsing, ping, and DNS queries.
- Applied protocol filters to analyze TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS traffic.
- Inspected packet details such as IP addresses, ports, and flags.
- Identified abnormal patterns such as repeated connection attempts.

---

## Analysis Performed
- Protocol-wise traffic analysis
- Source and destination IP inspection
- Detection of excessive requests and connection attempts

---

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with packet-level analysis
- Improved understanding of network protocols
- Ability to differentiate between normal and suspicious traffic

---

## Outcome
Gained practical experience in network traffic monitoring and analysis
using Wireshark for beginner-level security assessment.
